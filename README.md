## How It Works

Once installed, **Next.js File Highlighter** automatically scans your project’s `pages` and `app` directories (or any custom directories you specify) to identify and highlight important Next.js files. Highlights appear as colored badges or icons next to file names in the Explorer sidebar, providing immediate visual cues to enhance your navigation and file management.

Examples of highlighted files include:
- Files that define routes and layouts (e.g., `page.js`, `layout.tsx`)
- Files handling loading states (e.g., `loading.js`)
- Error boundary files (e.g., `error.js`)
- Custom head elements (e.g., `head.js`)
- And many other relevant Next.js-specific files
